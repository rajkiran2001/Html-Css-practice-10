Certainly! Let's break down the steps to create the Task Tracker application using VB.NET and a DataGridView.

Task Tracker Application Overview:
The Task Tracker application is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It features a DataGridView to display a list of tasks, with various customization options and interactive functionalities.

Step-by-Step Guidance:
Create a New VB.NET Project:

Open Visual Studio.
Create a new Windows Forms Application project.
Design the Form:

Drag and drop a DataGridView onto the form.
Adjust the column headers and properties as needed.
Define Task Class:

Create a Task class to represent individual tasks with properties like TaskID, TaskName, Description, DueDate, Status, Priority, etc.
vb
Copy code
Public Class Task
    Public Property TaskID As Integer
    Public Property TaskName As String
    Public Property Description As String
    Public Property DueDate As DateTime
    Public Property Status As String
    Public Property Priority As String
End Class
Initialize DataGridView:

Create a list of tasks in the form's code.
vb
Copy code
Dim taskList As New List(Of Task)()
Populate the DataGridView with the task list.
vb
Copy code
DataGridView1.DataSource = taskList
Handle DataGridView Events:

Use events such as CellFormatting, ColumnHeaderMouseClick, CellEndEdit, CellClick, SelectionChanged, RowPrePaint, and DataError to implement various functionalities.
Customize Appearance:

In the CellFormatting event, customize cell styles based on task attributes (e.g., overdue tasks, high-priority tasks).
Sorting and Filtering:

Handle the ColumnHeaderMouseClick event to implement sorting.
Implement the TextChanged event for filtering.
Editable Cells:

Use the CellEndEdit event to update the underlying data source when users edit task details.
Task Status Update:

Handle the CellClick event to trigger status updates.
Implement a context menu or buttons for status updates.
Task Details View:

Use the SelectionChanged event to display detailed information about a task in another part of the form.
Progress Bar for Completion:

Add a progress bar to visually represent task completion.
Update the progress bar when tasks are marked as complete.
Save and Load Data:

Implement functionality to save tasks to a file and load them back.
Enhanced Visual Styles:

Apply custom styles to cells, headers, and rows using the RowPrePaint event.
Context Menu Options:

Add context menu options for common actions.
Handle these actions using the ContextMenuStrip and associated events.
Testing and Refinement:

Test the application thoroughly, refining the UI and functionality as needed.
Documentation:

Document the code and application features for future reference.
Remember to handle exceptions appropriately, especially in data-related events, to ensure a robust application.

This step-by-step guide provides a foundation for creating the Task Tracker application using VB.NET and the DataGridView. Feel free to adapt and expand upon it based on your specific requirements and preferences. Good luck with your project!








Frontend Design:
Design the Form:

Open the form in the designer.
Set the form title to "Task Tracker."
DataGridView Setup:

Select the DataGridView on the form.
Set the AutoSizeColumnsMode property to Fill to make columns fill the available space.
Adjust column names and properties as needed (TaskID, TaskName, Description, DueDate, Status, Priority).
Status Bar:

Add a StatusStrip at the bottom of the form.
Add a ToolStripStatusLabel to display status messages.
Buttons and Controls:

Add buttons for common actions (e.g., Add Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete).
Add a DateTimePicker for setting due dates.
Add a ComboBox for selecting task priorities.
Group Box for Task Details:

Add a GroupBox to the form for displaying detailed information about the selected task.
Inside the group box, add labels to display TaskID, TaskName, Description, DueDate, Status, Priority.
Progress Bar:

Add a ProgressBar to visually represent task completion.
Set the Maximum property to 100.
Context Menu:

Add a ContextMenuStrip for the DataGridView to include options like Edit Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete, etc.
Arrange Controls:

Arrange controls in a logical and user-friendly manner.
Group related controls together for better organization.
Frontend Code:
Now, let's integrate the frontend code with the backend logic:

Initialize the DataGridView:

In the form's Load event, initialize the task list and bind it to the DataGridView.
vb
Copy code
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
    Dim taskList As New List(Of Task)()
    ' Add sample tasks to the list
    taskList.Add(New Task With {.TaskID = 1, .TaskName = "Task 1", .Description = "Description 1", .DueDate = DateTime.Now, .Status = "Incomplete", .Priority = "High"})
    taskList.Add(New Task With {.TaskID = 2, .TaskName = "Task 2", .Description = "Description 2", .DueDate = DateTime.Now.AddDays(2), .Status = "Incomplete", .Priority = "Medium"})
    DataGridView1.DataSource = taskList
End Sub
Handling DataGridView Events:

Implement the various DataGridView events in the form's code.
Button Click Events:

Implement click events for buttons (e.g., Add Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete).
Context Menu Events:

Implement events for the context menu options (Edit Task, Delete Task, Mark as Complete).
DateTimePicker and ComboBox Events:

Handle events for the DateTimePicker and ComboBox controls to update task due dates and priorities.
Update Task Details in the GroupBox:

Use the SelectionChanged event to update the details displayed in the GroupBox when a different task is selected.
Progress Bar Update:

Update the progress bar based on the completion status of tasks.
Status Messages:

Display status messages in the ToolStripStatusLabel to provide feedback to the user.
Here's a simple example for handling the "Add Task" button click event:

vb
Copy code
Private Sub btnAddTask_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnAddTask.Click
    ' Add a new task to the list
    Dim newTask As New Task With {
        .TaskID = taskList.Count + 1,
        .TaskName = "New Task",
        .Description = "Description",
        .DueDate = DateTime.Now,
        .Status = "Incomplete",
        .Priority = "Low"
    }
    taskList.Add(newTask)

    ' Refresh the DataGridView
    DataGridView1.DataSource = Nothing
    DataGridView1.DataSource = taskList

    ' Display a status message
    toolStripStatusLabel.Text = "New task added successfully."
End Sub
Repeat these steps for other buttons, controls, and events based on the functionalities you want to implement. This provides a foundation for the frontend of the Task Tracker application with a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.












Task ID 1 (High Priority): Design User Interface

This task is crucial for establishing the overall look and feel of the expense tracker.
Task ID 2 (High Priority): Set Up Database

Database setup is fundamental; it's a prerequisite for storing and managing expense data.
Task ID 3 (High Priority): User Authentication

Security is a top priority. Implementing user authentication early ensures data protection.
Task ID 4 (Medium Priority): Expense Entry Form

Creating a user-friendly form is essential but can be developed concurrently with other tasks.
Task ID 5 (Medium Priority): Expense Listing

Displaying and managing expenses is important but can be developed in parallel with other features.
Task ID 6 (Medium Priority): Expense Categories

Categorization enhances user experience; it's important but can be developed alongside other core features.
Task ID 7 (Medium Priority): Expense Analytics

Analytics provides valuable insights but can be implemented after the core functionality is in place.
Task ID 8 (Medium Priority): Responsive Design

Important for a seamless user experience but can be addressed after the core features are functional.
Task ID 9 (Low Priority): Testing and Debugging

Testing is crucial, but it can be conducted more effectively once the core features are implemented.
Task ID 10 (Low Priority): Deployment

Deployment is the final step; it's important but should follow thorough testing and development.
