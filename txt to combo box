TryCast:

The TryCast operator is used for a safe cast. It attempts to cast an object to a specified data type, and if the cast fails (i.e., if the object is not of the specified type or is Nothing), it returns Nothing instead of throwing an exception.
vb
Copy code
Dim comboBox As ComboBox = TryCast(e.Control, ComboBox)
In this line, TryCast is used to attempt to cast e.Control to a ComboBox. If e.Control is a ComboBox, comboBox will be assigned the reference to the ComboBox control; otherwise, it will be assigned Nothing.

DirectCast:

The DirectCast operator is used for an explicit cast. It attempts to cast an object to a specified data type, but if the cast fails, it throws an exception.
vb
Copy code
Dim comboBox As ComboBox = DirectCast(sender, ComboBox)
In this line, DirectCast is used to explicitly cast sender to a ComboBox. If sender is not a ComboBox or cannot be cast to a ComboBox, an exception will be thrown.

In the context of the provided code:

TryCast(e.Control, ComboBox) is used to attempt to cast the editing control of the DataGridView to a ComboBox. If successful, comboBox will refer to the ComboBox; otherwise, it will be Nothing.

DirectCast(sender, ComboBox) is used to explicitly cast the sender object to a ComboBox. This is performed in the ComboBox_SelectedIndexChanged event handler, assuming that sender is expected to be a ComboBox.

These casting operators help manage the types of objects and ensure type safety in your code. The choice between TryCast and DirectCast depends on whether you want to handle a potential failure gracefully (TryCast) or if you expect the cast to always succeed (DirectCast).
